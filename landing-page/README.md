## Description
This project is the fruits of labor of a 19 years old Egyptian computer science student who just wants to do a little better in life and acquire useful skills that would aid him in his journey of becoming a freelancer capable of handling major projects and working for reputable employers.

## Development
This site started out as a simple webpage developed by the Udacity team to help their students with the project by adding basic HTML elements and CSS styling to the page and the text it houses.
That was until I came and added a Navigation bar which allows you to scroll through the various sections of the page by clicking on the desired section title from the aforementioned bar.
A 'scroll to top' button was also added as a substitute for the inconvenience of manually scrolling back up the page.

## Usage
This webpage's sole purpose is to show that I have understood the lectures given in the course so far and am able to design dynamic pages and features.

## Special Thanks
I'd like to thank the Udacity for providing me with tools to help achieve my goals and the people behind the FWD initiative that gave the opportunity to do this.
